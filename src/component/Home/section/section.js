            <p>Physics (from Ancient Greek: φυσική (ἐπιστήμη), romanized: physikḗ (epistḗmē), lit. 'knowledge of nature', from φύσις phýsis 'nature')[1][2][3] is the natural science that studies matter,[4] its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of 
                energy and force.[5] Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, and its main goal is to understand how 
                the universe behaves.</p>
                <p>Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines and, through its inclusion of astronomy, perhaps the oldest.[9] Over much of the past two millennia, physics, chemistry, biology, and 
                    certain branches of mathematics were a part of natural philosophy, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th 
                    century these natural sciences emerged as unique research endeavors in their own right.[b] Physics intersects with many 
                    interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly 
                    defined. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences[6] and suggest new avenues of 
                    research in academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy.

                <p>But this is completely erroneous, and our view may be corroborated by actual observation more effectively than by any sort 
                    of verbal argument. For if you let fall from the same height two weights of which one is many times as heavy as the other, 
                    you will see that the ratio of the times required for the motion does not depend on the ratio of the weights, but that the 
                    difference in time is a very small one. And so, if the difference in the weights is not considerable, that is, of one is,
                     let us say, double the other, there will be no difference, or else an imperceptible difference,
                     in time, though the difference in weight is by no means negligible, with one body weighing twice as much as the other[18]
